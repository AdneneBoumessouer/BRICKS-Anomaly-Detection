# Anomaly Detection
This project aims at developping a Deep Learning model using an unsupervided method to detect surface anomalies on images.

## Overview

The method being used in this project is inspired to a great extent by the papers [MVTec AD — A Comprehensive Real-World Dataset for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection](https://www.mvtec.com/fileadmin/Redaktion/mvtec.com/company/research/mvtec_ad.pdf) and [Improving Unsupervised Defect Segmentation by Applying Structural Similarity to Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02011).
The method is devided in 3 steps: training, finetuning and testing.

## Dataset

The dataset being used is the [MVTec dataset](https://www.mvtec.com/company/research/datasets/mvtec-ad/).

## Prerequisites

### Dependencies
Libraries and packages used in this project: 
* `tensorflow-gpu 2.1.0`
* `Keras 2.3.1`
* `ktrain 0.13.0`
* `scikit-image 0.17.2`
* `opencv-python 4.2.0.34`
* `pandas 1.0.3`
* `numpy 1.18.1`
* `matplotlib 3.1.3`


### Download the Dataset
1. Download the mvtec dataset [here](https://www.mvtec.com/company/research/datasets/mvtec-ad/) and save it to a directory of your choice (e.g in /Downloads)
2. Extract the compressed files.
3. Create a folder named **mvtec** in the project directory.
4. Move the extracted files to the **mvtec** folder.


Directory Structure using mvtec dataset
------------
For the scripts to work propoerly, it is required to have a specific directory structure. 
In the case of using the *mvtec* dataset, here is an example of how the directory stucture should look like:

    ├── bottle
    │   ├── ground_truth
    │   │   ├── broken_large
    │   │   ├── broken_small
    │   │   └── contamination
    │   ├── test
    │   │   ├── broken_large
    │   │   ├── broken_small
    │   │   ├── contamination
    │   │   └── good
    │   └── train
    │       └── good
    ...


--------

Directory Structure using your own dataset
------------
To train with your own dataset, you need to have a comparable directory structure. For example:

    ├── class1
    │   ├── test
    │   │   ├── good
    │   │   ├── defect
    │   └── train
    │       └── good
    ├── class2
    │   ├── test
    │   │   ├── good
    │   │   ├── defect
    │   └── train
    │       └── good
    ...


--------

## Training (`train.py`)

During training, the CAE trains exclusively on defect-free images and learns to reconstruct (predict) defect-free training samples.

### Usage
usage: train.py [-h] -d  [-a] [-c] [-l] [-b] [-i]

optional arguments:

  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

  -d , --input-dir      directory containing training images

  -a , --architecture   architecture of the model to use for training: 'mvtecCAE', 'baselineCAE', 'inceptionCAE' or 'resnetCAE'

  -c , --color          color mode for preprocessing images before training: 'rgb' or 'grayscale'

  -l , --loss           loss function to use for training: 'mssim', 'ssim' or 'l2'

  -b , --batch          batch size to use for training

  -i, --inspect         generate inspection plots after training


Example usage:
```
python3 train.py -d mvtec/capsule -a mvtecCAE -b 8 -l ssim -c grayscale
```
**NOTE 1:** There is no need for the user to pass a number of epochs since the training process implements an Early Stopping strategy.

**NOTE 2:** There is a total of 4 models implemented in this project:
* *mvtecCAE* is the model implemented in the [MVTec Paper](https://www.mvtec.com/fileadmin/Redaktion/mvtec.com/company/research/mvtec_ad.pdf)
* *baselineCAE* is inspired by: https://github.com/natasasdj/anomalyDetection
* *inceptionCAE* is inspired by: https://github.com/natasasdj/anomalyDetection
* *resnetCAE* is inspired by: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.08921.pdf

**NOTE 3:**
The models *mvtecCAE*, *baselineCAE* and *inceptionCAE* are quite comparable in performance.
*resnetCAE* is still being tested.


## Finetuning (`finetune.py`)
This script approximates a good value for minimum area and threshold pair of parameters that should be used during testing to obtain good classification results. It relies on 10% of the defect-freee validation images and 20% of the defect and defect-free test images.

### Usage
usage: finetune.py [-h] -p  [-m] [-t]

optional arguments:

  -h, --help      show this help message and exit

  -p , --path     path to saved model

  -m , --method   method for generating resmaps: 'ssim' or 'l2'

  -t , --dtype    datatype for processing resmaps: 'float64' or 'uint8'


Example usage:
```
python3 finetune.py -p saved_models/mvtec/capsule/mvtecCAE/ssim/13-06-2020_15-35-10/mvtecCAE_b8_e39.hdf5 -m ssim -t float64
```

## Testing (`test.py`)

This script classifies test images using the threshold and the minimum defect area that have been previously determined by finetuning.

### Usage
usage: test.py [-h] -p

optional arguments:

  -h, --help    show this help message and exit

  -p , --path   path to saved model


Example usage:
```
python3 test.py -p saved_models/mvtec/capsule/mvtecCAE/ssim/13-06-2020_15-35-10/mvtecCAE_b8_e39.hdf5
```
